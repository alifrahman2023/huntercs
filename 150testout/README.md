# 150testout
Yeah, this is the hardest one.

I would preface this by saying that the course is very interesting and if you take it with Saad it'll be one of the hardest classes you will take. That may be good or bad depending on the type of person you are. In my opinion, I would take the course because I genuinely think it would make you smarter in all aspects of life (maybe I'm just a discrete glazer). Anyways, I tested out because my friends were so here we are.

### How I studied for the testout:

0. Register for the testout exam. Search up "Hunter CS testout registration". Follow the instructions there.

1. Learning. Search up TrevTutor on Youtube. He'll teach you most of Discrete except for proofs. How to learn proofs? There's multiple math proofs classes online but I learned proofs by just looking over the lecture slides and the practice tests. Oh and also search up MITCourseWare Discrete Mathematics. That might be helpful but I didn't have time to watch all of them so who knows. If you like textbooks, I would recommend the Ping textbook -- I didn't use it for the testout but I read it afterwards and I realized it was very helpful.

2. Look through the tests and lecture slides to learn the specifics of this class in Hunter. Practice the tests by not looking at the answers. 

3. Do the testout from memory. You're gonna have to find out if you're answers are right by yourself because the current GPT does not know how to do these problems correctly. Good luck.

6. Take the testout exam. When I took it you weren't allowed a cheat sheet so make sure you internalize all the information. If I were to give myself advice for the testout I would say this: remember the prime factorization theorem and that you can do counterexample proofs (can you guess which questions I fumbled on the testout from memory?)
