# 135testout
This is probably the easiest testout by far. There is a course page https://maryash.github.io/135/index.html but I didn't use it much since the test is just on basic c++. There are no funky 
libraries to learn like in CSCI 127. But that's just me, feel free to use it if you want.

I would preface this by saying that the course itself is not just learning C++. It's a very project-orientated course (some projects included making an rpg game and a 2048 game) 
that gives you good skills in actually programming and not just coding. However, I have already taken a course like this in high school (that included making projects) but in Java 
and am very familair with coding in general so I decided to learn C++ and skip this course.

### How I would study for the testout:

0. Register for the testout exam. Search up "Hunter CS testout registration". Follow the instructions there.

1. Watch some basic YouTube tutorials on Python and gain a basic understanding of the language. This is a [good one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw). Watch at 2x speed and skip
over obvious stuff. Feel free to pick any other Python for beginner tutorials instead.

2. Go to the course website and look over every lab and learn the libraries well. Also, look at their examples
since that is the type of code you can expect to see on the test. The hard topics would have to be pandas, numpy + matplotlib.pyplot, MIPS, folium, and c++ (if you are new to the langauge).
I would study those since those are topics that typically aren't discussed in Python for beginner YouTube videos.

3. The website also has practice exams and answer keys. If you don't understand a question/it's answer use ChatGPT to explain it to you. Beware, sometimes it uses way more complex code
than needed or doesn't use the library you want it to use so modify your questions based on that. Sometimes, it gets stuff wrong so just compare it with the answer key.
Sometimes, the answer key is wrong (I only saw one question where it was wrong though) so beware of that.

4. Practice until you get a 90% or higher on 2 of them. 

5. Take the testout exam. You are allowed to bring a one-page cheat sheet. I have one in this repo but feel free to use your own.
