# 135testout
This is probably the easiest testout by far. There is a course page https://maryash.github.io/135/index.html but I didn't use it much since the test is just on basic c++. There are no funky 
libraries to learn like in CSCI 127. But that's just me, feel free to use it if you want.

I would preface this by saying that the course itself is not just learning C++. It's a very project-orientated course (some projects included making an RPG game and a 2048 game) 
that gives you good skills in actually programming and not just coding. However, I have already taken a course like this in high school (that included making projects) but in Java 
and am very familiar with coding in general so I decided to learn C++ and skip this course.

### How I studied for the testout:

0. Register for the testout exam. Search up "Hunter CS testout registration". Follow the instructions there.

1. Youtube tutorials. This is a [good one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TkoO8Z07hI). After that, you can also use [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0x9eZLix4) if you want to learn more about OOP although abstraction and polymorphism didn't appear on the testout I took.

2. The majority of your learning will be through practice tests and using ChatGPT to explain stuff to you. I have a LOT of practice tests in this repo with answer keys. You can also go to the
maryash github repo and find tests. [Link to tests on her repo](https://github.com/maryash/maryash.github.io/tree/master/135/b2xkX2V4YW1z). I would recommend doing the finals on maryash's repo
first, then doing the finals on my repo, and finally using the testouts in this repo as your final practice exams (beware, the testouts and finals are structured very differently so you cannot
just practice on finals. You MUST practice the testouts).

4. The website also has practice exams and answer keys. If you don't understand a question/it's answer use ChatGPT to explain it to you. Beware, sometimes it uses way more complex code
than needed or doesn't use the library you want it to use so modify your questions based on that. Sometimes, it gets stuff wrong so just compare it with the answer key.
Sometimes, the answer key is wrong (I only saw one question where it was wrong though) so beware of that.

5. Practice until you get a 90% or higher on 2 of them. 

6. Take the testout exam. You are allowed to bring a one-page cheat sheet. I have one in this repo but feel free to use your own.
