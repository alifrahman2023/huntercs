# 135testout
This is probably the easiest testout by far. There is a course page https://maryash.github.io/135/index.html but I didn't use it much since the test is just on basic c++. There are no funky 
libraries to learn like in CSCI 127. But that's just me, feel free to use it if you want.

I would preface this by saying that the course itself is not just learning C++. It's a very project-orientated course (some projects included making an RPG game and a 2048 game) 
that gives you good skills in actually programming and not just coding. However, I have already taken a course like this in high school (that included making projects) but in Java 
and am very familiar with coding in general so I decided to learn C++ and skip this course.

### How I studied for the testout:

0. Register for the testout exam. Search up "Hunter CS testout registration". Follow the instructions there.

1. Youtube tutorials. This is a [good one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TkoO8Z07hI). After that, you can also use [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0x9eZLix4) if you want to learn more about OOP although abstraction and polymorphism didn't appear on the testout I took.

2. You can go through the course page if you want but I think the YouTube tutorials plus step 3 are enough.

3. The majority of your learning will be through practice tests and using ChatGPT to explain stuff to you. I have a LOT of practice tests in this repo with answer keys. You can also go to the
maryash github repo and find tests. [Link to tests on her repo](https://github.com/maryash/maryash.github.io/tree/master/135/b2xkX2V4YW1z). Beware, the testouts and finals are structured very differently so you cannot just practice on finals. You MUST practice the testouts. The order I recommend: Do the finals on maryash's repo first, then do the finals in this repo, and finally do the testouts in this repo as your final practice exams before the actual test.

4. Practice until you get a 90% or higher on 3 of them (these tests should not take too long, try to do at least 2 a day leading up to the test).

5. Take the testout exam. You are allowed to bring a one-page cheat sheet. I have one in this repo but feel free to use your own. It's double-sided which may technically not be allowed but
the TA who hosts the room never checks.
