# 127testout
This is probably the testout that has the most resources given by Hunter. The entire curriculum is on [https://huntercsci127.github.io/f23.html](https://huntercsci127.github.io/f23.html). 
If you are seeing this years later just change the f23, which means fall 2023, to f{whatever_year} or s{whatever_year} (so for example if you want to look at the website for spring 2027
the link would be https://huntercsci127.github.io/s27.html). If they abandon this style of links just search "Hunter CSCI127 course page" and try to find the most recent one.

If you are familiar with coding but rusty on your Python (like I was) I would not make the same mistake I did which was taking the course. Personally, it was boring since I relearned everything very fast. However, if you are part of Macaulay Honors, the honors recitation for this course is slightly interesting as it focuses on data analysis. Your choice.

### How I would study for the testout:

0. Register for the testout exam. Search up "Hunter CS testout registration". Follow the instructions there.

1. Watch some basic YouTube tutorials on Python and gain a basic understanding of the language. This is a [good one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw). Watch at 2x speed and skip
over obvious stuff. Feel free to pick any other Python for beginner tutorials instead.

2. Go to the course website and look over every lab and learn the libraries well. Also, look at their examples
since that is the type of code you can expect to see on the test. The hard topics would have to be pandas, numpy + matplotlib.pyplot, MIPS, folium, and c++ (if you are new to the langauge).
I would study those since those are topics that typically aren't discussed in Python for beginner YouTube videos.

3. The website also has practice exams and answer keys. If you don't understand a question/it's answer use ChatGPT to explain it to you. Beware, sometimes it uses way more complex code
than needed or doesn't use the library you want it to use so modify your questions based on that. Sometimes, it gets stuff wrong so just compare it with the answer key.
Sometimes, the answer key is wrong (I only saw one question where it was wrong though) so beware of that.

4. Practice until you get a 90% or higher on 2 of them. 

5. Take the testout exam. You are allowed to bring a one-page cheat sheet. I have one in this repo but feel free to use your own.
