Say you already took Discrete Math or (if you didn't) say you took the placement exam
and results are yet to be released (so send this email ideally during winter break or
the summer).

Attach your AP Score report with a 5 in AP Calculus BC.
Attach your transcript that shows a high GPA.

The email I sent:
Hello,
I hope this email finds you well.

I am currently a freshman at Hunter College via the Macaulay Honors Program. I am requesting 
permission to take MATH250 ( Calculus III ) without taking one of the prerequisite classes ( MATH 156 ). 
Based on what I have seen from the MATH156 syllabus, almost all of the content in the class overlaps 
with what I have learned from self-studying CSCI150 (Discrete Structures).  I have taken the placement 
exam, but the results are yet to be released. In studying for the exam, I have developed knowledge of 
sets, proofs, and induction and I believe this knowledge makes it so that I would be able to handle the 
proofs in Calculus 3. I received a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam and have a 4.0 GPA (proof attached to 
this email) so I believe I can handle skipping this class. I humbly ask that you permit me to get past 
the MATH 156 requirement so that I can take Calculus 3 sooner.

Reach out if you need anything else!

Best,
Alif Rahman.
